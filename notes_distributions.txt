Uniform distributions have equal likelyhoods amont all outcomes, like a fair coin.
    - For example, rolling a fair die, flipping a coin, fair odds all around
Binomial distributions are all about determining a binary outcome of an event. 
    - Success/failure, Correct/Incorrect, True /False
Normal distributions model a continuous random variable.
    - Bell Curve
Poisson distributions a certain amount of events occuring over a time interval
    - Dealing with time, most likely Poisson.
